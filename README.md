# GrooveIn

A lightweight AI-powered emotion-based music recommender that uses NLP and Spotify playlists. Built with Python, TF-IDF, logistic regression, and Streamlit UI.

## Project Overview

GrooveIn is an interactive, mood-based music recommendation system that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Spotify playlist embedding to recommend songs based on how you're feeling and what genre you prefer.

Whether you're happy, sad, angry, romantic, or just want something chill, GrooveIn detects your emotional state from a text input and recommends the perfect track or playlist based on your input.
